I'm migrating everything to a new folder since the old structure was
set up for use on the UCSF cluster. Also want to clean up the directory
structure so that it's easier to track


I'm mostly just copying over the code from before, though changing file names to
be more precise. I'm adding a '-o' and '-s' flag to the copied over scripts 
(transformations.py and fragments_adducts.py) that respectively can specify an 
output and summary file directory. 

Also the way that things are written right now, fast_merge.py takes an 
input directory and scrapes all the adducts and transformation files.
I'm changing it so that it requires an adduct file and a transformation file
just to make things cleaner.

NOTE (merge.py) - The way it's currently written it scrapes a directory and 
takes all the input and adduct files into lists and parses them. I don't want
to dive too deeply into rewriting now so I'm just going to have the existing
list variables only have the single adduct and transformation files as 
passed by the user via required flags.

I'm also changing the output file names to just be inputname_transformations.csv
etc etc.
